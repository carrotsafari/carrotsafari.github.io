## Eating Habits
Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs (and apparently also Elizabeth Holmes) are known for minimizing decisions and making things simple by wearing the same thing everyday. I find that this is also a good technique with food, [as do some others](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/). 

I eat essentially the same breakfast and lunch every day and have a couple of dinner variation options. 

## Main Techniques
Here are the main ways that I cook with about as little skill as possible.

**Hard boiled eggs:** With a hard boiled egg cooker, you put eggs into little slots, fill up a measuring cup up to the right level, and flip the switch. No waiting for water to boil or forgetting how much time the eggs need to cook for (I used to constantly forget about them) since the machine buzzes very loudly when it's finished. I cook 12 at a time every few days in the mornings.

**Steamed vegetables:** These go in the same hard boiled egg cooker, which doubles as a vegetable steamer. It can fit about 8-12 oz of most types of vegetables and takes 10ish minutes to steam. Again, just adding a bit of water, loading in the vegetables, and turning it on, and 

**Chicken breasts:**

## Food Sources
I generally have enjoyed going to supermarkets. It's the first thing I like to do when visiting a new place and the feeling of wide aisles and picking your own produce and wandering around finding new things can be fun. I also find it pretty easy to exhibit willpower of not buying junk food in the supermarket.
