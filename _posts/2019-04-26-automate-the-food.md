## Eating Habits
Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs (and apparently also Elizabeth Holmes) are known for minimizing decisions and making things simple by wearing the same thing everyday. I find that this is also a good technique with food, [as do some others](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/). 

I eat essentially the same breakfast and lunch every day and have a couple of dinner variation options. 

## Main Principles

## 1. Eat Nearly the Same Thing Every Day
Eating the same thing for the main meals is surprisingly not very boring and is highly recommended. Maybe do some small variations with snacks and certain meal elements, but keep the same structure every day! 

## 2. Avoid Manual Labor and Guesswork as Much as Possible
Before I discovered the hard boiled egg machine, I never knew what I was doing. I'd forget about the eggs more often than not and even when I remembered and timed them fairly well, I frequently had peeling issues. Here is a list of my favorite tools: 

## 3. Cook in Bulk
I only do this for foods that I don't mind eating cold, which are currently Israeli salad and hard boiled eggs. The time to cook a chicken breast on an indoor grill is so low and the value from eating it hot off the grill is so high, that I don't think it's worth bulk cooking and reheating an item like this. 

## 4. Eat Healthy Stuff
I find it very easy to have willpower in supermarkets and very difficult to have willpower when unhealthy foods are available for eating in my surroundings. I find it nice to keep the base state under control so that when less healthy situations arise (restaurants, parties, random occurrences of low-percentage chocolate in the vicinity), they can be enjoyed without concern. I've also found that I feel better when eating healthier. (I think of healthy as mostly Paleo, i.e. mostly proteins/nuts/seeds/vegetables/olive oil, with some fruit and 85%+ chocolate, and avoiding processed foods. I like this strictish definition because it means there's little guessing about whether an item is in the program or out of the program, but of course all should set their own baseline to their situation.)

## 5. Get Food Delivered
I generally have enjoyed going to supermarkets. It's the first thing I like to do when visiting a new place and the feeling of wide aisles and picking your own produce and wandering around finding new things can be fun. If I had easy access to a quality/good value supermarket, I'd probably prefer to go there 1-2 times/week. Recently I've been primarily using Amazon's PrimeNow for Whole Foods deliveries, which has been a pretty mediocre experience overall, but is free for same/next day 2-hour delivery windows and is ridiculously easy and when issues come up, their support has been very quick and generous. 

## 6. A Day in the Life
### Breakfast
- 3 scrambled eggs: Cooked in olive oil with raw sunflower seeds added after plating. The biggest efficiency improvement I've made here is not pre-stirring the eggs. Just crack them into the pan and stir! 
- 4 oz chicken breast: Cooked on an indoor grill with nothing added
- Israeli salad: Chopped up tomatoes/cucumbers/peppers and potentially onions. Important to use yellow or orange peppers so they don't get confused for tomatoes (red) or taste terrible (green). Top with olive oil. 

### Lunch
- 3 hard boiled eggs: Cooked in bulk and eaten cold. I enjoy pre-eating the whites and sprinkling the yolks into the salad [Salt Bae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Bae) style.
- 4 oz chicken breast: If taking lunch to go, cook this with the morning breast
- 1/2 salad bag: Ready to eat salad bags, topped with 
- Vegetables: If at home, I always steam frozen vegetables (usually broccoli, sometimes a mix). This can be done during the breakfast cooking if taking lunch to go, but tends to not taste great cold. Israeli salad is a good alternative. 
- I find it very efficient to eat this with hands, but that should definitely not be done in public and probably not even admitted in a public blog.

### Snacks

**Hard boiled eggs:** With a hard boiled egg cooker, you put eggs into little slots, fill up a measuring cup up to the right level, and flip the switch. No waiting for water to boil or forgetting how much time the eggs need to cook for (I used to constantly forget about them) since the machine buzzes very loudly when it's finished. I cook 12 at a time every few days in the mornings.

**Steamed vegetables:** These go in the same hard boiled egg cooker, which doubles as a vegetable steamer. It can fit about 8-12 oz of most types of vegetables and takes 10ish minutes to steam. Again, just adding a bit of water, loading in the vegetables, and turning it on, and
