## Eating Habits
Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs (and apparently also Elizabeth Holmes) are known for minimizing decisions and making things simple by wearing the same thing everyday. I find that this is also a good technique with food [as do some others](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/). 

I eat essentially the same breakfast and lunch every day and have a couple of dinner variation options. 

## Main Techniques
Here are the main ways that I cook with about as little skill as possible: 

Hard boiled egg: 

Steamed vegetables: 

Chicken breasts: 

Scrambled eggs: 

One oil: 

Israeli salad: Figure out your tomato/cucumber/pepper ratio and get this [pro vegetable chopper](https://www.amazon.com/Chopper-Vegetable-Mueller-Vegetable-Fruit-Cheese-Onion-Chopper-Dicer-Kitchen/dp/B01HC7BNJA)

## Food Sources
I generally have enjoyed going to supermarkets. It's the first thing I like to do when visiting a new place and the feeling of wide aisles and picking your own produce and wandering around finding new things can be fun. I also find it pretty easy to exhibit willpower of not buying junk food in the supermarket.

Kosher pastured chicken breasts: 
Kosher grassfed beef:
