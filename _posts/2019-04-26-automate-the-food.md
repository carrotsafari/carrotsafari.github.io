## Eating Habits
Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs (and apparently also Elizabeth Holmes) are known for minimizing decisions and making things simple by wearing the same thing everyday. I find that this is also a good technique with food, [as do some others](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/eating-the-same-thing-lunch-meal/584347/). 

I eat essentially the same breakfast and lunch every day and have a couple of dinner variation options. 

## Main Principles

## 1. Eat Nearly the Same Thing Every Day
Eating the same thing for the main meals is surprisingly not very boring and is highly recommended. Maybe do some small variations with snacks and certain meal elements, but keep the same structure every day! 

## 2. Avoid Manual Labor and Guesswork as Much as Possible
Before I discovered the hard boiled egg machine, I never knew what I was doing. I'd forget about the eggs more often than not and even when I remembered and timed them fairly well, I frequently had peeling issues. Here is a list of my favorite tools and streamlining ideas: 

**Hard boiled egg cooker:** With a hard boiled egg cooker, you put eggs into little slots, fill up a measuring cup to the right level, and flip the switch. No waiting for water to boil or forgetting how much time the eggs need to cook for since the machine buzzes very loudly when it's finished. I cook 12 at a time every few days in the mornings for use in salads. Vegetables can be steamed in the same device! It can fit about 8-12 oz of most types of vegetables and takes 10ish minutes to steam. Again, just adding a bit of water, loading in the vegetables, and turning it on.<br>

**Indoor grill:** Though this is a bit of a compromise at dinner, I am very happy with the chicken breasts produced for breakfast/lunch. I think there's essentially no easier way to cook protein than to plug in a grill, wait a couple minutes, and just drop the item inside and wait a few more minutes. No flipping, no oil splashing all over, and in the case of chicken breasts, no serious timing issues since slightly overcooked isn't a big disaster. 

**The oven:** 

**Scrambled eggs:** I used to 

**One oil:** I use one extra virgin olive oil for everything from cooking eggs to salmon to putting on salads. Lately I've been very into ones with olive from California. Trader Joe's and Whole Foods have their own brands with California olives that are both rated very well by Consumer Reports (though the review is from 2012). There's also been a lot of [shadiness with olive oil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2016/02/10/the-olive-oil-scam-if-80-is-fake-why-do-you-keep-buying-it/#56896ffe639d) from Europe.<br>

**Vegetable chopper:** Figure out your tomato/cucumber/pepper ratio and get this [pro vegetable chopper](https://www.amazon.com/Chopper-Vegetable-Mueller-Vegetable-Fruit-Cheese-Onion-Chopper-Dicer-Kitchen/dp/B01HC7BNJA)

**Kosher:** Meat or dairy, pick one. Literally all of the complication from having a kosher home comes from separating meat and dairy. If you go the meat route and you insist on dairy, uncooked things like candy or chocolate bars are still pretty easy to keep around since they don't use dishes or cooking instruments. 

**A good nonstick pan:** brand of mine, dishwashable

**Keep bulk stocks:**

**Use frozen vegetables:** Frozen vegetables are generally cheaper than fresh and never worrying about expiration is amazing. Based on some reading, it seems that they tend to have more nutrients than 

**Use frozen meats:** Frozen 

**Strong tupperware:**

**Let randomness dictate:** I like automating reminders, but don't have any system for knowing when to get more food


## 3. Cook in Bulk
I only do this for foods that I don't mind eating cold, which are currently Israeli salad and hard boiled eggs. The time to cook a chicken breast on an indoor grill is so low and the value from eating it hot off the grill is so high, that I don't think it's worth bulk cooking and reheating an item like this. 

## 4. Eat Healthy Stuff
I find it very easy to have willpower in supermarkets and very difficult to have willpower when unhealthy foods are available for eating in my surroundings. I find it nice to keep the base state under control so that when less healthy situations arise (restaurants, parties, random occurrences of low-percentage chocolate nearby), they can be enjoyed without concern. I've also found that I feel better when eating healthier. (I think of healthy as mostly Paleo, i.e. mostly proteins/nuts/seeds/vegetables/olive oil, with some fruit and 85%+ chocolate, and avoiding processed foods. I like this strictish definition because it means there's little guessing about whether an item is in the program or out of the program, but of course all should set their own baseline to their situation.)

## 5. Get Food Delivered
I generally have enjoyed going to supermarkets. It's the first thing I like to do when visiting a new place and the feeling of wide aisles and picking your own produce and wandering around finding new things can be fun. If I had easy access to a quality/good value supermarket, I'd probably prefer to go there 1-2 times/week. Recently I've been primarily using Amazon's PrimeNow for Whole Foods deliveries, which has been a pretty mediocre experience overall, but is free for same/next day 2-hour delivery windows and is ridiculously easy and when issues come up, their support has been very quick and generous.

Additionally, I've been getting all meats/fish from online sources. 
Salmon: 
Chicken/steak: 

## 6. A Day in the Life
### Breakfast
- 3 scrambled eggs: Cooked in olive oil with raw sunflower seeds added after plating. The biggest efficiency improvement I've made here is not pre-stirring the eggs. Just crack them into the pan and stir! 
- 4 oz chicken breast: Cooked on an indoor grill with nothing added
- Israeli salad: Chopped up tomatoes/cucumbers/peppers and potentially onions. Important to use yellow or orange peppers so they don't get confused for tomatoes (red) or taste terrible (green). Top with olive oil. 
- Total cooking/prep time is under 5 minutes

### Lunch
- 3 hard boiled eggs: Cooked in bulk and eaten cold. I enjoy pre-eating the whites and sprinkling the yolks into the salad [Salt Bae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Bae) style.
- 4 oz chicken breast: If taking lunch to go, cook this with the morning breast
- 1/2 salad bag: Ready to eat salad bags, topped with 
- Vegetables: If at home, I always steam about half a bag of frozen vegetables (usually broccoli, sometimes a mix). This can be done during the breakfast cooking if taking lunch to go, but tends to not taste great cold. Israeli salad is a good alternative. 
- Total cooking/prep time is about 10 minutes with the vegetables being the limiting factor
- If eating at the office, keep a bottle of olive oil on site so you don't have to commute with the risk of an olive oil explosion. 
- I find it very efficient to eat this with hands, but that should definitely not be done in public and probably not even admitted in a public blog. 


### Dinner
- Protein option: Either 8 oz steak or 8 oz salmon fillet. I have been cooking the steak on the indoor grill, but there would probably be more value from a more complicated/longer cooking method. Salmon broiled in the oven is a great option, but I've also sometimes been using the grill in cases of laziness. 
- Vegetables: Steam half a bag of frozen vegetables
- Rice: On salmon days I sometimes eat rice. I hate the cleanup value of cooking rice in a pot. Alternatives are microwaveable bags, boilable bags, and rice cookers. I think the ease of microwaveable makes that my favorite current option. 
- Total cooking/prep time is about 10 minutes, potentially a bit longer if waiting for the oven to heat up

### Snacks
- Raw almonds: 
- Carrots: 
- 85%+ dark chocolate: 
- Good fruit (berries): 
- Less good fruit (apples, bananas, grapes): 
- Avocado: Great fat source! I can't deal with the erratic quality differences and ripeness issues
