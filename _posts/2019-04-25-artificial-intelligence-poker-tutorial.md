## 1. Poker Background

### Brief History
Poker began at some point in the early 20th century and grew extensively in the early 2000s thanks to the beginnings of online poker, which lead to an accountant and amateur poker player named Chris Moneymaker investing $39 in an online satellite tournament that won him a $10,000 seat at the World Series of Poker Main Event in 2003, alongside 838 other entrants. Moneymaker went on to defeat professional poker player Sam Farha at the final table of the tournament and won $2.5 million. A poker boom was sparked and led to massive player pools on the Internet and in subsequent World Series‚Äô of Poker.

After the human poker boom, computers also started getting in on the poker action. Researchers began to study solving Texas Hold‚Äôem games since 2003, and since 2006, there has been an Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC) at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in which poker agents compete against each other in a variety of poker formats. Almost all competitions and research in the realm of poker is done on the most popular game, Texas Hold‚Äôem, which can be played with set bet sizing, ‚Äúlimit‚Äù, or as a ‚Äúno limit‚Äù game where, as implied, one can bet any amount up to what one has in front of him on the table. In early 2017, for the first time, a NLHE poker agent defeated and is considered superior to top poker players in the world.

### Basic Rules
Poker is a card game that, in its standard forms, uses a deck of 52 cards composed of four suits (Clubs :clubs:, Diamonds :diamonds:, Hearts :heart:, and Spades :spades:) and 13 ranks (Two through Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). A dealer button rotates around the table indicating who is the ‚Äúdealer‚Äù. This is decided at random for the first hand and rotates clockwise after that. All actions begin to the left of the hand‚Äôs current dealer player.

We will focus on two player games and ignore any fees (also known as rake) such that the games will be zero-sum. Further, to simplify the games, we will reset each player‚Äôs starting chips to the same amount before every hand. The two players play a match of independent games, also called hands, while alternating who is the dealer.
Each hand starts with the dealer player posting the small blind and the non-dealer player posting the big blind. The blinds define the stakes of the game (for example, a $1-$2 stakes game has blinds of $1 and $2) and the big blind is generally double the small blind. They are called blinds because they are forced bets that must be posted ‚Äúblindly‚Äù. The player to the left of the big blind, in this case the dealer player, begins the first betting round by folding, calling, or raising. (In some games antes are used instead of or in addition to blinds, which involves each player posting the same ante amount in the pot before the hand.)
Each game goes through a series of betting rounds that result in either one player folding and the other winning the pot by default or both players going to ‚Äúshowdown‚Äù after the final round, in which both show their hands and the best hand wins the pot. The pot accumulates all bets throughout the hand. The goal is to win as many chips from the other player as possible.
Betting options available throughout each round are: fold, check, call, bet, and raise.
Fold means not putting in any chips and ‚Äúquitting‚Äù the hand by throwing the cards away and declining to match the opponent‚Äôs bet. Check or call means that a player contributes the minimum necessary to stay in the hand based on previous action. If no previous bet was made, this is called a check, which means putting in no further chips, but still staying in the hand (this is also referred to as a pass). If previous bets were made, then one puts in the exact amount of the bet, a call.
Betting or raising is when players put in more chips than needed to stay in the hand and generally represents a strong hand, although the actual hand could be strong or weak, in which case the player would be bluffing. In the case of betting, 0 chips were required to continue, but the player decides to wager chips. Raising is when an opponent player bet and a call was possible, but instead additional chips are added (effectively calling and betting together).

### Kuhn (1-card) Poker
Kuhn Poker is the most basic useful poker game that is used in computer poker research. It was solved analytically by hand by Kuhn in 1950 [6]. Each player is dealt one card privately and begins with two chips. In the standard form, the deck consists of only three cards ‚Äì an Ace, a King, and a Queen, but can be modified to contain any number such that the cards are simply labeled 1 through n, with a deck of size n. Our first experiment will use a deck size of 100 to compare different CFR algorithm implementations.

Players each ante 1 chip (although most standard poker games use blinds, this basic game does not) and rotate acting first, and the highest card is the best hand. With only 1 chip remaining for each player, the betting is quite simple. The first to act has the option to bet or check. If he bets, the opponent can either call or fold. If the opponent folds, the bettor wins one chip. If the opponent calls, the player with the higher card (best hand) wins two chips.

If the first to act player checks, then the second player can either check or bet. If he checks, the player with the best hand wins one chip. If he bets, then the first player can either fold and player two will win one chip, or he can call, and the player with the best hand will win two chips.

### Leduc Poker
Leduc Poker is a simple toy game that has more in common strategically with regular Texas Hold'em. 

**Deck size:** 6 cards -- 2 Jacks, 2 Queens, 2 Kings
**Rounds:** 2 rounds -- 1 private card preflop, 1 community flop card
**Blinds/Antes:** $1 ante
**Betting structure:** All bets $2 in the first round and $4 in the second round with a limit of one bet and one raise per round
**Starting 

Each betting round follows the same format. The first player to act has the option to check or bet. When betting the player adds chips into the pot and action moves to the other player. When a player faces a bet, they have the option to fold, call or raise. When folding, a player forfeits the hand and all the money in the pot is awarded to the opposing player. When calling, a player places enough chips into the pot to match the bet faced and the betting round is concluded. When raising, the player must put more chips into the pot than the current bet faced and action moves to the opposing player. If the first player checks initially, the second player may check to conclude the betting round or bet. In Leduc Hold‚Äôem there is a limit of one bet and one raise per round. The bets and raises are of a fixed size. This size is two chips in the first betting round and four chips in the second.

### Texas Hold'em Poker
The purpose of this final paper is to examine the evolution of computer poker research and algorithms and to apply this research to simplified poker games. We will compare different algorithms used to compute ùúñ- Nash equilibrium strategies in a two-player zero-sum game setting and then will analyze game abstraction techniques that can carry over to larger poker games and to other imperfect information research in general.
A number of games have been used as artificial intelligence research domains including chess, checkers, Go, and poker, but poker is unique amongst these games because of its key element of imperfect information. In poker, this is the inability to see one‚Äôs opponent‚Äôs hole cards. Additionally, poker is an excellent research bed for game theoretical research because it has chance events, it is logistically simple yet strategically complex, and it is commonly and competitively played around the world by humans of a variety of skill levels [1]. Further, games can be scaled to be extremely complex or extremely simple and therefore work can also be performed to analyze abstraction techniques and how algorithms perform in different game environments. Finally, it is interesting to see that computers automatically find strategies such as bluffing and slow playing.
Unlike perfect information games, imperfect information games tend to have more in common with real world decision making settings. Solving such games can be translated into solving real-world applications with similar properties, and applications can be found, for example, in security, including decisions about which stations to deploy officers to, and in medical decision support [2].

This paper will focus primarily on two-player No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem (NLHE), in which, in the standard version, each player receives two private cards and can use up to five shared community cards that are revealed over the course of multiple betting rounds. Although the rules of play are relatively simple, Texas Hold‚Äôem is a very deep and complex game.
The remainder of this paper will be organized with a chapter about the scientific background of game solving techniques applicable to poker and imperfect information games, then a literary review of the history of game solving research and the advancement of poker agents. Finally, we will show two experiments involving different versions of imperfect information card games and how the results can improve poker research in the future.
This paper‚Äôs first experiment is to solve a toy 1-card poker game using a variety of implementations of the state of the art game theoretic solution algorithm,

counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). The purpose of this experiment is to compare the different algorithms and to analyze the final solution of the game.
The second experiment is to solve a testbed poker game called Royal No Limit Hold‚Äôem using CFR and then to compare different action abstractions in the game. Royal NLHE can be tractably solved, unlike the full game of No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem, which requires abstraction because of its size (unlike the large, but much smaller limit-betting variation, which was solved in full in early 2015 by a team at the University of Alberta [2]). Experimenting with a game that can be completely solved allows us to evaluate different abstractions against the full game equilibrium, which would otherwise not be possible in an intractable game setting.
Real-life decision making settings almost always involve missing information and uncertainty, so it is important to see algorithmic advances in solving games under such settings. We expect that comparisons between different CFR algorithms and between abstractions in Royal Hold‚Äôem will provide useful insights into improved solutions for the full game of No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem and potentially to other applications as well.

1.1.1 Texas Hold‚Äôem Poker
Each hand in Texas Hold‚Äôem consists of four betting rounds. Betting rounds start with each player receiving two private cards, called the ‚Äúpreflop‚Äù betting round, then can continue with the ‚Äúflop‚Äù of three community cards followed by a betting round, the ‚Äúturn‚Äù of one community card followed by a betting round, and a final betting round after the fifth and final community card, called the ‚Äúriver‚Äù. Community cards are shared and are dealt face up.

In no limit betting, the minimum bet size is the smaller of the big blind or a bet faced by the player and the maximum bet size is the amount of chips in front of the player. In the case of a two-player game, the dealer button pays the small blind and acts first preflop and then last postflop.
In limit betting, bets are fixed in advance based on the stakes of the game and the blinds. For example, with 2-4 blinds, the bets preflop and on the flop are 4 and on the turn and river, they are doubled to 8. In limit betting, there is a maximum of four bets and raises per betting round per player, which, in addition to the limited available set of actions, makes limit-based games significantly smaller than their no-limit counterparts.
On each round, players combine their private cards with the community cards to form the best possible 5-card poker hand, which could include 0, 1, or 2 private cards.
