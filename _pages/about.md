I'm generally interested in AI and machine learning and specifically interested in games and reinforcement learning. I wrote my MSc thesis on [Solving Poker Games Using Counterfactual Regret Minimization](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcgszjng6u5gj0b/MaxChiswickCFRThesis.pdf?dl=0) (finished at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 2017).
