## Hobbies
- Hiking/cycling/improving very poor flexibility -- my two biggest adventures were cycling from Cairo to Cape Town (12000km/7500mi) on the Tour d'Afrique for 4 months in 2016 and hiking Israel from North to South (1025km/630mi) for 1.5 months in 2017
- Travel -- I've spent a bit too much time traveling, much of it in not-very-touristy countries in Africa
